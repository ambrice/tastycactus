### Timesheet ###

Timesheet is an application designed primarily for contractors and freelancers to track the time spent on 
different tasks.

You can add billable tasks and unbillable tasks (such as "Lunch") and get a daily or weekly report of time spent on each.

Timesheet is open source, licensed under the GPL.  Source code can be found on [github](http://github.com/ambrice/timesheet).

<% @site.sorted_articles.find_all {|a| a[:project] == 'Timesheet' }.each do |post| %>
<%= post.reps.find { |r| r.name == :default }.content_at_snapshot(:summary) %>
<% end %>
